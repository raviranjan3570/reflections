1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Ans: When we want to share our repository with others.

2. When might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Ans: When someone else is working upon our remote repo and we don't want our work to get affected by their work.

3. Describe between the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Ans: Fork copies the repo in our github account.
Clones download the repo in our machine.
Branches just split the repo into parts so that our work doesn't affect the working branch.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of remote stored locally?

Ans: This comes in handy when we are working offline.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or Github? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Ans: Without using git or github we can collaborate by normally sharing our work or source code.
Git would be easier.
Sharing will be difficult as there is a chance of breaking the software completly.

6. When would you want to make changes in a seperate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Ans: When we are working for new feature or bug fixes trhen we would want to make changes in seperate branch so that our work does not affect the master branch or working software.
